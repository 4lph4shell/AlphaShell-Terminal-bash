# Full Package

Depending on the scope of changes and feature enhancements that are added to an existing web shell’s source code, these updates can be tedious and time consuming for bad actors. For this reason, it’s common to see code for web shells reused among different, unaffiliated attackers.

The ALFA-TEaM shell contains an enormous number of features, the latest version v7.4.7.
When comparing v7.47’s PHP code, we can see the following new features, which are not present in v3 of the web shell:

</p>

The first three are just variations of existing features (e.g coldumper) and relatively common among multi-featured PHP web shells.
Let’s focus on the behavior of the last three features: ** fakepage, config_grabber, and archive_manager. ** 

# Fake Page 
In my opinion, ** fakepage ** is of the most interesting new features added to v7.4.7. It allows the attacker to create an on-the-fly phishing page for the two most common hosting control panels: cPanel and DirectAdmin.
